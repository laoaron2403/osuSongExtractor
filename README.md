# osuSongExtractor
Gather all your mp3 files into a single folder from your /osu!/Song, rename them repective to song name in map file data.

## Target
1. Extract .mp3 song files from /osu!/Songs folder and gather them onto a single folder
2. Each .mp3 file has the name of the song (parsing from the map's metadata)
3. (Optional) Each .mp3 file has the wallpaper of the map as its image.
 
## Thoughts
1. https://github.com/mpatric/mp3agic for editing metadata (including embed image)
	1. How do I add dependencies to the project with Maven?
